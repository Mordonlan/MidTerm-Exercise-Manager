MidTerm-Exercise-Manager
Introduction-

As my midterm project, I have the pleasure of introducing MidTerm-Exercise-Manager — your personal digital workout companion.
With MidTerm-Exercise-Manager, you can log your sports activities, track sets and reps, record weights (or bodyweight exercises), and even estimate the calories you’ve burned so far.
There are currently 3 main functionalities:
Exercise Tracking
An exercise entry contains:
Sport / Activity name

Number of sets
Reps per set
Weight used (optional — for bodyweight exercises, leave it blank)
Calories burned estimate


Summary Table
View a neatly formatted table showing:
All logged exercises
Total sets completed for each activity
Total weight lifted (if applicable)
Total calories burned
Statistics
At the end, you get a clear overview of your training session — perfect for staying motivated and seeing your progress over time.
